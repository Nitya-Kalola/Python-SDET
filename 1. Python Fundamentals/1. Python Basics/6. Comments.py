This looks like a comment
but it’s actually a string literal.

def add(a, b):
    """Returns the sum of a and b""" # This is Docstring which is used to explain a function, classes, modules.
    return a + b

# Docstring is different than Comment

# Best Practices to write the comments:
"""
Keep comments short
Focus on intent
Update comments when updating code
Don’t comment obvious logic
Use docstrings for methods, not comments
Use comments for hacks, workarounds, explanations
